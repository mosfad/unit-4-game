#CrystalsCollector Game#

This program engages the user in a number guess game, using crystal buttons. To start the game, the program will pick a random number and show it to the player. There will also be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific number of points to the total score. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the start of the game. The player loses if their total score is above the random number. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses a game. The program automatically generates a new random number to start a new game and four hidden numbers for each of the crystal buttons. The program resets the players total score to 0, but maintains the number of wins and losses for all the games played.

The program is a wonderful way to improve logic and counting abilities. It's also a wonderful way to break out of your daily routine to play a fun numbers game. This game would also be a great way to teach elementary students about the concepts of counting and addition.

*Please start the game by pressing the any of the four crystal buttons*. After the program displays the random number, use the updated total score to figure out the value of the each of crystal buttons. With more practice, you will become adept at racking up wins and feeling great. You can also completely reset the whole game by refreshing your browser.
